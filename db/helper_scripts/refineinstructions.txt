1. Execute clustering in openrefine

2. Export json of steps performed

3. Copy steps into openrefine.json

4. Execute refine.py which will convert the json into a flat file for import into PSQL

5. Add table for name conversion

CREATE TABLE name_mapping (
    original_name TEXT,
    normalized_name TEXT
);

6. Backup original column

ALTER TABLE device ADD COLUMN manufacturer_d_name_original TEXT;
UPDATE device SET manufacturer_d_name_original = manufacturer_d_name;

7. Modify column with clustered values

UPDATE device t
SET manufacturer_d_name = nm.normalized_name
FROM name_mapping nm
WHERE t.manufacturer_d_name = nm.original_name
  AND t.manufacturer_d_name IS DISTINCT FROM nm.normalized_name;
